## What is Annie
Annie is a library-framework, a libwork or framebrary if you will, to build enterprise applications. Annie is the code name for the client side component. I would describe it as a library that exposes capabilities and features to create REAL applications easily and quickly. Based on Vanilla js, you can easily expand the capabilities to meet your needs.


Annie is a new way to build enterprise applications. Annie is designed to work with the backend out of the gate. All UI applications connect to server side code (PHP, Java, C#, etc.) which in turn stores data somewhere (MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, NoSQL, Hadoop, etc.)

The focus of Annie, therefore, is to create a complete REAL application, work with data, and pass it to the backend; rather than simply a static UI website.


## Supporting Annie

Annie is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible entirely by crazy people who think they can offer something better than the likes of Google and Facebook. If you'd like to support them, please consider:
